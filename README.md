ui for spleeter

This is a simple ui for spleeter by deezer.

in the source folder u will find the source code for the .py files used to create the ui and separate the audio;
also theres gonna be all the necesary files for u to create a vitrtualenv and run the source python file

and a folder with complementary content that needs to be pasted to the final pyinstaller output folder, otherwise the .exe doesnt run.

finally there will be built .exe zip folders for u to just download and run the program.

in the future i will be adding a .exe that install fine tuned stems on ur bhzspleeter folder;
and a less bloated ui for u to modify more easily.
